# Convolution Neural Network

## Topics covered in today's module
* Convolution neural network components
* Visualizing kernels
* Visualizing feature maps
* Pooling
* Dropout
* Batch norm

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
Convolution neural network components (forward pass, backprop, pooling, etc)
Different types of overfitting solutions (dropout, batch norm)

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Finally understanding convolution a little more
I plan to tackle the bonus question eventually
Might need a check on my question 3, though
